# Sonar Mine vs. Rock Classifier

## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals and determine whether they correspond to a mine or a rock. By analyzing the numerical data representing sonar signal properties, the model learns to distinguish between the two classes with accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, handling null values, and data exploration.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical examination and visualization to understand the data distribution.
- **Modeling**: Using logistic regression to train a binary classification model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parthdave333/sonar-mine-vs-rock-classifier.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
         jupyter notebook SONAR mine vs rock.ipynb

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to see data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 60 feature columns with numerical values representing sonar signal intensities and a target column indicating the class ('M' for mine, 'R' for rock).

## Results
The project includes performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy to validate the model's effectiveness in classifying sonar signals and identifying the class weather SONAR signals reflect off a rock or a mine.

## Future Improvements
Experimenting with other classification models like Decision Trees or Neural Networks.
Optimizing the model through feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.
Incorporating cross-validation for more robust performance measures.
